Using the C programming language, write a Linux/UNIX program that represents a version of the ls command.
The program takes the name of a directory as an argument and displays a list of directories within it, one line per directory, with the following information:
directory name, the number of files in it, and the size in bytes (size represents the sum of sizes of files in the directory).
