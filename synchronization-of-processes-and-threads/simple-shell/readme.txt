Using the C programming language, write a Linux program that simulates the functionality of a simple shell.
This shell should execute programs found in the current directory or in any directory listed in the PATH environment variable.
Additionally, it should allow the execution of a called program in the background by specifying the '&' character as the last argument in the command line.
Immediately after, it should display a prompt ready to receive a new command.
