Using the C programming language, write a Linux program that demonstrates the capabilities of redirecting standard input and output.
The program takes two command-line arguments: the path to the executable file and the path to a text file.
The program opens the text file and redirects the standard output to that opened file. It then creates a new process and loads the specified executable file.
The effect of this program is to redirect the output of each invoked program into the selected text file.
