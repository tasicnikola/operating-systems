Using the C programming language, write a UNIX/Linux program that consists of two processes (producer-consumer) communicating through a bounded circular buffer in shared memory.
The circular buffer has a size of 10 integers.
These processes synchronize their activities (buffer write and buffer read) using semaphores.
