Using the C programming language, write a UNIX/Linux program that reads data from a text file line by line.
Subsequently, using message queues, it sends all even-numbered lines to a process that converts all letters to uppercase and writes them to a file named "half1".
It also sends all odd-numbered lines to another process that converts all letters to lowercase and writes them to a file named "half2".
